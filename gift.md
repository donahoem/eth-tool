# Crypto Starter Kit (Ethereum edition)

**Congratulations!**  You are the proud new owner of an Ethereum wallet into which I have deposited **0.025 ETH**.  You have also received access to my **eth-tool** program which you can use to quickly create new wallets, check the balance of any wallet, or send funds from one wallet to another.  Don't know how this works?  Keep reading!

## Basics

The Ethereum network has countless **addresses** (or wallets) which can send and receive Ethereum.  Each address has a unique **private key**.  Anyone with the private key for an address has complete control over the funds in that wallet, *so do not ever share your private key with anyone*.  If you wish to learn more about how addresses and private keys are related, read up on **assymetric cryptography**.

## eth-tool

I have included instructions on how to download and use the **eth-tool** which I have  made.  This tool allows you to create new wallets, check the balance of wallets, and send ETH from one wallet to another.  *Since I know your private key, you should probably use it to create a new wallet and transfer your funds over to it.*

## How do I sell it?

The easiest way would be to create an account on a crypto exchange such as **Coinbase**.  Your Coinbase account will have another wallet which you can send ETH to, and then sell for USD on their exchange.
